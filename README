========================

This is a collection of C and Python programs to address the fascination I
have had with both computuer science and Rubik's cubes ever since I've been
a child.

Michael Reid has written a cool solvers that runs really fast on modern
hardware (http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Rubik/index.html). I use an
adaptation of his code as a general solver. The changes I made are purely to
drive it automatically.

Code is documented and serves as the manual. Happy hunting.

If you see anything interesting, have questions or just want to share
something, please drop me an email.

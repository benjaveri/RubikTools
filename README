======================

This is a collection of C and Python programs to address the fascination I
have had with both computuer science and Rubik's cubes ever since I've been
a child.

Michael Reid has written a cool solvers that runs really fast on modern
hardware (http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Rubik/index.html). I use an
adaptation of his code as a general solver. The changes I made are purely to
drive it automatically.

Code is documented and serves as the manual. Happy hunting.

Layout

./solver/               Michael Reid's code adapted to be machine driven
./utils/                Numerous command line utilities
./utils/face2cube.py    turns a facecolor description into a solver compatible cubie description

If you see anything interesting, have questions or just want to share
something, please drop me an email.
